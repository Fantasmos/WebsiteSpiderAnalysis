# WebsiteSpiderAnalysis

A project I worked on for scraping data from a website and storing for later analysis and usage in a CSV file. This project would undergo direct modifications to deal with the individual website being scraped from and restoring from several points after crashing, however as that is irrelavent I have just included the base code here. 

Goes without saying this was a rush job scrapped together, if anyone finds enjoyment in it i'm glad, if you find education in it, beware.
